= Pre-Release Steps

These steps can be done before the actual release (eg., on the Thurs or Fri before the Monday release, as long as QE has more-or-less signed off). Check with QE before proceeding.


== Clone jbosstools-build-ci repo or link to it from elsewhere on disk

[source,bash]
----

mkdir -p /tmp/jbt.github
cd /tmp/jbt.github
if [[ -d ~/tru/jbosstools-build-ci ]]; then ln -s ~/tru/jbosstools-build-ci; fi
if [[ ! -d jbosstools-build-ci ]] && [[ -L jbosstools-build-ci ]]; then git clone git@github.com:jbosstools/jbosstools-build-ci.git; fi
cd jbosstools-build-ci
git checkout master # later jbosstools-4.5.x
chmod +x -R */*.sh */*/*.sh

----


== Remind devs about JIRA triage

Kick this job to send reminder emails to the team, in case some issues are not yet resolved.

[source,bash]
----

# kerberos login for the Jenkins server
export userpass=KERBUSER:PASSWORD

ccijenkins=https://dev-platform-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job
JP=/tmp/jbt.github/jbosstools-build-ci/util/jenkinsPost.sh
for j in jbosstools-jiralint-weekly; do
  ${JP} -s ${ccijenkins} -j ${j} -t build
done

== Update http://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/

Ping Mike Guerette & Erin Rooney a couple weeks in advance to get this stuff ready in in time for GA.

Goal is to update the following pages to include links to guides and to set the correct latest GA release version:

* http://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/download/
* http://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/hello-world/
* http://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/docs-and-apis/

The download page will be automatically updated when new downloads are uploaded into "Download Manager" and no further action is needed.
