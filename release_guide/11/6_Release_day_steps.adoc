On Release Day (currently the Monday after the end of the GA sprint), there are a few remaining TODOs to do:

== Release latest JBoss Tools and Devstudio downloads and latest blog to tools.jboss.org

Push the blog PR [0] and the update to include the latest JBT and devstudio versions [1] to both the master [2] and production [3] branches, then wait about 2 x 3 mins for Travis [4] to rebuild everything

[0] https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-website/pull/ ???

[1] https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-website/pull/765

[2] http://tools.stage.jboss.org/downloads/overview.html and http://tools.stage.jboss.org/blog/

[3] http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/overview.html and http://tools.jboss.org/blog/

[4] https://travis-ci.org/jbosstools/jbosstools-website


== Release staged bits to production customer portal and Download Manager

* Tell RCM (Chris O'Brien / siege on IRC) to release the staged stuff in the customer portal to production, via the RCM tickets [5], [6].

[5] https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23773

[6] https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/RCM-23774 + all linked RCM tickets for stage and production


== Announce releases to mailing lists

Send email announcements to the mailing lists (one for jBT, one for devstudio) - see details in these emails, usually sent on the Wed or Thursday after the end of the sprint:

* Ready for JBoss Developer Studio 11.1.0.GA blog & announcement
* Ready for JBoss Tools 4.5.0.Final blog & announcement


== Check Devstudio marketing materials are updated to include latest devstudio 11.1.0.GA release

* https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/overview/
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/download/
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/hello-world/
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/docs-and-apis/
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/devstudio/updates/

If anything is not correct, please ping Mike Guerette immediately.
