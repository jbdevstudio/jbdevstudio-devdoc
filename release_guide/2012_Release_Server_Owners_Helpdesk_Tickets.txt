Feel free to add more names / issues / servers / workflows as needed. ~nboldt

	devstudio.jboss.com is an alias for devstudiovip.proxy.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com, which has address 10.4.127.7. 
	It is managed by servicedesk (even if they say it is managed by eng-ops).

	bandwidth issues: servicedesk@redhat.com, mgalgoci@redhat.com (Matt Galgoci)

	DNS problems: servicedesk@redhat.com, eng-systems-mw@redhat.com 
		Example: ticket INC000000358304, https://remedy.corp.redhat.com/arsys/forms/remedy.corp.redhat.com/HPD:Help+Desk/Best+Practice+View/
		Contacts: 
			trobert@redhat.com (Robert Theisen, Sr. Systems Admin)

	ssh/sftp access: servicedesk@redhat.com
		Process:
			1. Optimal method is to have the manager send the email requesting access for the associate.
			2. Or - associate can send email to manager, gain approval, then send email to servicedesk.
			3. Else, if the associate requests to servicedesk, they will reach out to the manager for approval, then forward to the appropriate team. 
				> What level of access will be required on wallace.redhat.com?
				They just need ssh access in, and write permissions for the same folders in which I currently have access.

				> Is there a common group for all users that we can grant access to?
				I'm in the "devstudio" group, as per the /etc/group file

				>  Is there an area of the filesystem that you will be pulling data to?
				/mnt/devstudio & /home/remote/nboldt

				> Who has write permission to that area of the filesystem?
				Anyone in the aforementioned "devstudio" group, I suppose. Unless you use facl control too, that is.

				>  What commands will need to be used to pull data?
				rsync -aPrz --rsh=ssh <username>@dev01...redhat.com:~/RHDS/<some path> /mnt/devstudio/<some other path>
