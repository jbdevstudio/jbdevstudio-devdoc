This doc is a work in progress as we are required to interact with the various IT organizations.

Feel free to add more names / issues / servers / workflows as needed. ~nboldt


== https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com == 

	stalled/bad slave nodes: ci-issues@redhat.com
		Process:
			1. cancel jobs running on the slave (if possible). 
			2. take slave offline w/ comment explaining why. 
			3. send email to ci-issues@ asking slave be restarted and added back into the pool, with links to slave's page in Hudson and
			   any relevant jobs/logs proving the problem exists.

== wallace.redhat.com == 

	DNS problems: servicedesk@redhat.com, eng-systems-mw@redhat.com 
		Example: ticket INC000000358304, https://remedy.corp.redhat.com/arsys/forms/remedy.corp.redhat.com/HPD:Help+Desk/Best+Practice+View/
		Contacts: 
			trobert@redhat.com (Robert Theisen, Sr. Systems Admin)

	ssh/sftp access: servicedesk@redhat.com
		Process:
			1. Optimal method is to have the manager send the email requesting access for the associate.
			2. Or - associate can send email to manager, gain approval, then send email to servicedesk.
			3. Else, if the associate requests to servicedesk, they will reach out to the manager for approval, then forward to the appropriate team. 
				> What level of access will be required on wallace.redhat.com?
				They just need ssh access in, and write permissions for the same folders in which I currently have access.

				> Is there a common group for all users that we can grant access to?
				I'm in the "devstudio" group, as per the /etc/group file

				>  Is there an area of the filesystem that you will be pulling data to?
				/mnt/devstudio & /home/remote/nboldt

				> Who has write permission to that area of the filesystem?
				Anyone in the aforementioned "devstudio" group, I suppose. Unless you use facl control too, that is.

				>  What commands will need to be used to pull data?
				rsync -aPrz --rsh=ssh <username>@dev01...redhat.com:~/RHDS/<some path> /mnt/devstudio/<some other path>

			Chris -- Please push JBDS installers to staging CSP, links below in email from Nick Boldt. (Email re: bits staged for QE)

			This should also include updating links in these two places:
				https://access.redhat.com > Software Downloads > Free Software

				https://access.redhat.com > Software Downloads > JBoss Developer Studio

			Len -- Copying you on ticket so your team can do smoke test when Chris confirms.

			Isaac -- Bits will go live Tuesday 7-Feb. Can you queue the release notes to post then as well?

			Heinz -- Could you add JBDS 4.1.2 to support pulldowns 7-Feb?
